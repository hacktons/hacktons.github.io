/**
 * {@code Activity} which displays a fullscreen Flutter UI.
 * <p>
 * {@code FlutterActivity} is the simplest and most direct way to integrate Flutter within an
 * Android app.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Dart entrypoint, initial route, and app bundle path</strong>
 * <p>
 * The Dart entrypoint executed within this {@code Activity} is "main()" by default. To change the
 * entrypoint that a {@code FlutterActivity} executes, subclass {@code FlutterActivity} and
 * override {@link #getDartEntrypointFunctionName()}.
 * <p>
 * The Flutter route that is initially loaded within this {@code Activity} is "/". The initial
 * route may be specified explicitly by passing the name of the route as a {@code String} in
 * {@link FlutterActivityLaunchConfigs#EXTRA_INITIAL_ROUTE}, e.g., "my/deep/link".
 * <p>
 * The initial route can each be controlled using a {@link NewEngineIntentBuilder} via
 * {@link NewEngineIntentBuilder#initialRoute}.
 * <p>
 * The app bundle path, Dart entrypoint, and initial route can also be controlled in a subclass of
 * {@code FlutterActivity} by overriding their respective methods:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getAppBundlePath()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getDartEntrypointFunctionName()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getInitialRoute()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The Dart entrypoint and app bundle path are not supported as {@code Intent} parameters due to
 * security concerns. If such configurations were exposed via {@code Intent}, then a
 * {@code FlutterActivity} that is {@code exported} from your Android app would allow other apps to
 * invoke arbitrary Dart entrypoints in your app by specifying different Dart entrypoints for your
 * {@code FlutterActivity}. Therefore, these configurations are not available via {@code Intent}.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Using a cached FlutterEngine</strong>
 * <p>
 * {@code FlutterActivity} can be used with a cached {@link FlutterEngine} instead of creating a new
 * one. Use {@link #withCachedEngine(String)} to build a {@code FlutterActivity} {@code Intent} that
 * is configured to use an existing, cached {@link FlutterEngine}.
 * {@link io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngineCache} is the cache that is used to obtain a
 * given cached {@link FlutterEngine}. An {@code IllegalStateException} will be thrown if a cached
 * engine is requested but does not exist in the cache.
 * <p>
 * When using a cached {@link FlutterEngine}, that {@link FlutterEngine} should already be executing
 * Dart code, which means that the Dart entrypoint and initial route have already been defined.
 * Therefore, {@link CachedEngineIntentBuilder} does not offer configuration of these properties.
 * <p>
 * It is generally recommended to use a cached {@link FlutterEngine} to avoid a momentary delay
 * when initializing a new {@link FlutterEngine}. The two exceptions to using a cached
 * {@link FlutterEngine} are:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When {@code FlutterActivity} is the first {@code Activity} displayed by the app, because
 *   pre-warming a {@link FlutterEngine} would have no impact in this situation.</li>
 *   <li>When you are unsure when/if you will need to display a Flutter experience.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The following illustrates how to pre-warm and cache a {@link FlutterEngine}:
 * <p>
 * {@code
 *   // Create and pre-warm a FlutterEngine.
 *   FlutterEngine flutterEngine = new FlutterEngine(context);
 *   flutterEngine
 *     .getDartExecutor()
 *     .executeDartEntrypoint(DartEntrypoint.createDefault());
 *
 *   // Cache the pre-warmed FlutterEngine in the FlutterEngineCache.
 *   FlutterEngineCache.getInstance().put("my_engine", flutterEngine);
 * }
 * <p>
 * <strong>Alternatives to FlutterActivity</strong>
 * <p>
 * If Flutter is needed in a location that cannot use an {@code Activity}, consider using
 * a {@link FlutterFragment}. Using a {@link FlutterFragment} requires forwarding some calls from
 * an {@code Activity} to the {@link FlutterFragment}.
 * <p>
 * If Flutter is needed in a location that can only use a {@code View}, consider using a
 * {@link FlutterView}. Using a {@link FlutterView} requires forwarding some calls from an
 * {@code Activity}, as well as forwarding lifecycle calls from an {@code Activity} or a
 * {@code Fragment}.
 * <p>
 * <strong>FlutterActivity responsibilities</strong>
 * <p>
 * {@code FlutterActivity} maintains the following responsibilities:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Displays an Android launch screen.</li>
 *   <li>Displays a Flutter splash screen.</li>
 *   <li>Configures the status bar appearance.</li>
 *   <li>Chooses the Dart execution app bundle path and entrypoint.</li>
 *   <li>Chooses Flutter's initial route.</li>
 *   <li>Renders {@code Activity} transparently, if desired.</li>
 *   <li>Offers hooks for subclasses to provide and configure a {@link FlutterEngine}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Launch Screen and Splash Screen</strong>
 * <p>
 * {@code FlutterActivity} supports the display of an Android "launch screen" as well as a
 * Flutter-specific "splash screen". The launch screen is displayed while the Android application
 * loads. It is only applicable if {@code FlutterActivity} is the first {@code Activity} displayed
 * upon loading the app. After the launch screen passes, a splash screen is optionally displayed.
 * The splash screen is displayed for as long as it takes Flutter to initialize and render its
 * first frame.
 * <p>
 * Use Android themes to display a launch screen. Create two themes: a launch theme and a normal
 * theme. In the launch theme, set {@code windowBackground} to the desired {@code Drawable} for
 * the launch screen. In the normal theme, set {@code windowBackground} to any desired background
 * color that should normally appear behind your Flutter content. In most cases this background
 * color will never be seen, but for possible transition edge cases it is a good idea to explicitly
 * replace the launch screen window background with a neutral color.
 * <p>
 * Do not change aspects of system chrome between a launch theme and normal theme. Either define
 * both themes to be fullscreen or not, and define both themes to display the same status bar and
 * navigation bar settings. To adjust system chrome once the Flutter app renders, use platform
 * channels to instruct Android to do so at the appropriate time. This will avoid any jarring visual
 * changes during app startup.
 * <p>
 * In the AndroidManifest.xml, set the theme of {@code FlutterActivity} to the defined launch theme.
 * In the metadata section for {@code FlutterActivity}, defined the following reference to your
 * normal theme:
 *
 * {@code
 *   <meta-data
 *     android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.NormalTheme"
 *     android:resource="@style/YourNormalTheme"
 *     />
 * }
 *
 * With themes defined, and AndroidManifest.xml updated, Flutter displays the specified launch
 * screen until the Android application is initialized.
 * <p>
 * Flutter also requires initialization time. To specify a splash screen for Flutter initialization,
 * subclass {@code FlutterActivity} and override {@link #provideSplashScreen()}. See
 * {@link SplashScreen} for details on implementing a splash screen.
 * <p>
 * Flutter ships with a splash screen that automatically displays the exact same
 * {@code windowBackground} as the launch theme discussed previously. To use that splash screen,
 * include the following metadata in AndroidManifest.xml for this {@code FlutterActivity}:
 *
 * {@code
 *   <meta-data
 *     android:name="io.flutter.app.android.SplashScreenUntilFirstFrame"
 *     android:value="true"
 *     />
 * }
 * <p>
 * <strong>Alternative Activity</strong>
 * {@link FlutterFragmentActivity} is also available, which is similar to {@code FlutterActivity}
 * but it extends {@code FragmentActivity}. You should use {@code FlutterActivity}, if possible,
 * but if you need a {@code FragmentActivity} then you should use {@link FlutterFragmentActivity}.

   * then this {@code FlutterActivity} will not automatically manage the connection between its

   * automatically. A developer can choose to subclass {@code FlutterActivity} and then
   * invoke {@link ActivityControlSurface#attachToActivity(Activity, Lifecycle)}
   * and {@link ActivityControlSurface#detachFromActivity()} at the desired times.
   * <p>
   * One reason that a developer might choose to manually manage the relationship between the
   * {@code Activity} and {@link FlutterEngine} is if the developer wants to move the
   * {@link FlutterEngine} somewhere else. For example, a developer might want the
   * {@link FlutterEngine} to outlive this {@code FlutterActivity} so that it can be used
   * later in a different {@code Activity}. To accomplish this, the {@link FlutterEngine} may
   * need to be disconnected from this {@code FluttterActivity} at an unusual time, preventing
